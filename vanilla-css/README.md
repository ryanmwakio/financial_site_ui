# Khusapay UI (case study)

A user interface for a fictional payment platform created using css and html by [Ryan Mwakio](https://ryanmwakio.netlify.app "Ryan website")

![Kusapay Hero Image](./images/screen.png)

The project is hosted on [case-study-v8.netlify.app](https://case-study-v8.netlify.app/ "Khusa pay website") for the vanilla css and [case-study-v8-tailwind.netlify.app](https://case-study-v8-tailwind.netlify.app/ "Khusa pay website") for the Tailwind based UI

To run the project just clone it into your file system and run the index.html file either through a server or just double click on it, it will open on the browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanmwakio/case-study.git
```
